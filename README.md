# Code Roaster 🥵☕️

Code Roaster is a fun and goofy Visual Studio Code extension that roasts your code every time you save a file. Whether you need a laugh or just want to add some flavor to your coding experience, this extension is here to bring a little spice to your day.

## Features ✨

Roasts on Save: Automatically throws a snarky roast at you whenever you save a file.
Manual Roasting: Trigger a roast anytime by running the "Run Code Roaster" command.
Start-up Activation: Code Roaster is ready to roast as soon as you open VS Code.
Custom Messages: Packed with a variety of funny, sarcastic, and brutal one-liners about your code.

## Installation 📦

Open Visual Studio Code.
Go to the Extensions View (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for Code Roaster.
Click Install.
Enjoy being roasted! 🥴

## Usage 🛠️

Automatic Roasts
Save any file, and Code Roaster will roast you instantly.
Manual Roasts
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).

## Example Roasts 🔥

Here are some examples of the spicy feedback you’ll get:

"Wow, did ChatGPT write this code for you?"
"Your code has more bugs than an anthill."
"Bold of you to assume this will compile."
"This looks like JavaScript pretending to be Python."

## Configuration ⚙️
